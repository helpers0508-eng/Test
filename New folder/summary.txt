  - Updated `/booking-confirmation` to checkout page collecting location, contact, and payment details
- **Responsive Design**: Maintained 3-column grid on desktop, stacked on mobile, proper touch targets and accessibility

### Backend API Specifications
- **GET /api/services**: Returns service catalog with id, title, duration, base_price

3. Mobile responsiveness (stacked form, touch targets)
4. Session persistence (refresh page, data retained)
5. Race condition simulation (multiple tabs booking same slot)
6. Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

### Business Logic Updates
